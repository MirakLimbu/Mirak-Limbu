        pages, i got some skills to create simple web pages. As this page was easy to create than others so, I did not
        take any reference for creating this page.</p>

      Registration Form Page:
      <p class="par">This Registration Form page is simply created and it has java script functions. The html, css and
        javascript
        containing in this page was all simply coding which was taught in college. While creating this page i
        did not face any problems so i did't take any reference for this page as well.</p>

      Contact Page:
      <p class="par">The design of this page is simple and adorable. It has a Home bottom at top left side which
        function as taking to main home page. Also, it has some input box to put some information and message which can
        be submitted by clicking submit bottom. The reference i took to create this web page was from youtube videos and
        some images that i found on google. But in youtube video, that page has no Javaacript but it has. The javascript
        function is in this page is that the input box cannot left empty and wrong input can not be accepted.</p>
